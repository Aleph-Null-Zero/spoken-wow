"""The addon zips: one for Blizzard's clients, one apiece for the older ones, and the player.

A WoW client before flavor suffixes opens `Spoken_Quests.toc` and nothing else, so what these
pin is which single .toc each legacy zip carries and which vendored Ace3 travels with it. Both
mistakes are silent - the addon simply does not load, or loads a library that binds an API the
client has never had - and neither shows up until somebody launches that client.

One more thing is pinned: the legacy zips carry Spoken itself, because those clients have no
addon manager to install a dependency, and what they carry must be byte-identical to Spoken's
own tree. Spoken's own zip carries its modules: one download with everything in it.
