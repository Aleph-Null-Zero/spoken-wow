#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds the last release of each retired CurseForge project, spoken-quests, spoken-zones and
# spoken-books: a zip holding only a tombstone under the folder name that project shipped.
#
#   ./scripts/spoken/package-retired.sh                 # dist/SpokenQuests-<version>.zip, and Zones', Books'
#   ALLOW_DIRTY=1 ./scripts/spoken/package-retired.sh   # build from an uncommitted tree
#
# WHY A RELEASE AT ALL. The modules ship inside Spoken's zip now, from Spoken_Quests,
# Spoken_Places and Spoken_Readables. A player who still has a retired project installed keeps its
# folder, the module's full old copy, which loads beside the renamed one and voices every line a
# second time. Updating the retired project to this file replaces that copy with a tombstone,
# a .toc that never loads (addons/SpokenQuests/SpokenQuests.toc explains it), and the old names
# are why the modules moved: whatever the CurseForge app does to a retired project's folders on
# update or removal, it now does to folders Spoken's zip does not ship.
#
# The tombstone goes under every .toc name the old folder had on Blizzard's clients, so no
# client finds a name the tombstone missed and loads the old Lua through it. Each copy carries
# the Interface line of the .toc the same client reads from the renamed module. The 1.12, 2.4.3
# and 3.3.5 names are not here: those clients never had CurseForge, and the quests addon's own
# legacy zips carry the tombstone for them (scripts/quests/package.sh).
#
# The version is Spoken's, and every template must say the same: the three projects retire with
# the release that moved the folders, and the release scripts read each project's version off
# its template (scripts/quests/release.sh's player target, scripts/zones/release.sh and
# scripts/books/release.sh), so a template that drifted would name a zip this did not build.
