-- SpokenZones -- narrate an area when the player discovers it.
--
-- The trigger is the game's own discovery, the moment it prints "Discovered
-- Durotar". Nothing else comes close:
--
--   * Zone-change events do not fire for it. A new orc stands in Valley of Trials,
--     which is a subzone of Durotar, so GetBestMapForUnit already answers "Durotar"
--     from the first second. Walking out into open Durotar changes no map ID.
--   * Tracking first visits ourselves means deciding when a visit starts, and any
--     answer to that is a guess. The client already knows, exactly, and remembers
--     per character across sessions for free.
--
-- The game fires a discovery once and never again, which is precisely the
-- semantics this feature wanted.
--
-- The cost of leaning on it is that a character who explored Azeroth before
-- installing SpokenZones already spent every discovery it will ever get, and so is
-- narrated nothing at all. The `autoplayExplored` option answers that by keeping
-- the record here instead -- see "Per-character record" below -- and narrating on
-- zone change rather than on discovery. It is off by default, and on a fresh
-- character it changes nothing observable: the discovery message still arrives
-- first and marks the area heard, leaving the override with nothing to say.
