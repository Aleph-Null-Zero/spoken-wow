-- A place this addon has no lore for, as something a player can describe.
--
-- No text, unlike the quests and books envelopes: zone lore is wiki-sourced rather than
-- client-sourced, so the client has nothing to hand over. What this sends names the place --
-- the map, the zone, the subzone -- and the contribute page asks the player for the part that
-- is actually missing: a description of it.
--
-- It travels the same format for one reason: one triage queue for three addons.
