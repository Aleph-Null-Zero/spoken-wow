/**
 * One line of any of the three corpora, as the triage table shows it.
 *
 * CLIENT-SAFE ON PURPOSE, like lib/zones/filters.ts: the expanded row runs in the browser,
 * and every module that can answer "what is this line?" on the server reaches the corpus,
 * the database or the filesystem. Types cross freely; runtime code does not, so the three
 * ResultLine shapes are narrowed here from what the search endpoints already return.
 *
 * The three agree on nothing - quests has `lineId`, `audioPath` and `hasAudio`, zones and
 * books have `id`, `file` and a `state` - so the reading is done once, here, rather than in
 * a row that would silently render an empty panel if it reached for the wrong pair.
